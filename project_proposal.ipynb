    "# Project Proposal: Predicting NCAA Basketball Championship Winner\n",
    "\n",
    "## Team Members\n",
    "- Brandon Poblette\n",
    "- Geof Spilker\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Name\n",
    "**Predicting NCAA Basketball Championship Winner**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** The dataset for this project will be sourced from publicly available NCAA basketball statistics, such as from Kaggle (e.g., \"NCAA Basketball Dataset\" or \"March Madness Dataset\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Format:** CSV or JSON format, depending on the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contents:**\n",
    "The dataset will include historical data from NCAA basketball tournaments, possibly spanning several years. It will contain information about the teams, their performance, and attributes such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Team Name**: The name of the college basketball team.\n",
    "- **Win-Loss Record**: The win-loss record of each team during the regular season.\n",
    "- **Seed**: The seed of the team in the tournament (1 through 16 for each region).\n",
    "- **Points Scored**: Total points scored by the team.\n",
    "- **Points Allowed**: Total points allowed by the team.\n",
    "- **Field Goal Percentage**: Shooting efficiency.\n",
    "- **Free Throw Percentage**: Performance from the free-throw line.\n",
    "- **Rebounds**: Total rebounds per game.\n",
    "- **Assists**: Total assists per game.\n",
    "- **Turnovers**: Total turnovers committed.\n",
    "- **Tournament Result**: A binary outcome (win/loss) indicating whether the team won the NCAA championship in that year.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Information\n",
    "- **Target Variable (Class to Predict):** The class we will predict is whether a team wins the NCAA championship in a given year. This can be modeled as a binary classification problem:\n",
    "  - **1**: The team won the NCAA championship.\n",
    "  - **0**: The team did not win.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation/Technical Merit\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will involve building a classification model that can predict the likelihood of a college basketball team winning the NCAA championship. This will involve:\n",
    "1. **Data Pre-processing**: Handling missing values, normalizing numeric attributes, and encoding categorical features (e.g., team name).\n",
    "2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that may improve the model's performance (e.g., team performance metrics like average points per game).\n",
    "3. **Model Selection**: Exploring classification models such as Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Decision Trees to predict the outcome.\n",
    "4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.\n",
    "5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters to enhance prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anticipated Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Imbalance**: There may be a disproportionate number of teams that did not win compared to those that did, leading to a skewed dataset. Techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or adjusting class weights will be considered.\n",
    "- **Feature Selection**: With many attributes potentially influencing the outcome, deciding which features are the most impactful will be important.\n",
    "- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset might have missing or inconsistent data, requiring thorough cleaning and transformation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Feature Selection Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "If the dataset has a large number of features, we will explore various feature selection techniques, such as:\n",
    "- **Correlation Matrix**: To identify highly correlated features that might be redundant.\n",
    "- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: A method to select the most relevant features based on model performance.\n",
    "- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: To reduce dimensionality by transforming the features into a smaller set of uncorrelated components.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Impact of the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Predictive Insights**: This project will provide insights into the factors that influence a college basketball team's chances of winning the NCAA championship.\n",
    "- **Sports Analytics**: The results could be used by sports analysts, coaches, and enthusiasts to predict outcomes of future tournaments.\n",
    "- **Fan Engagement**: Sports fans may use this tool to evaluate their teams' chances and engage more deeply with the tournament.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why are these Results Useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "This model will help stakeholders in college basketball, such as:\n",
    "- **Coaches**: To understand the strengths and weaknesses of their team relative to other teams in the tournament.\n",
    "- **Sports Analysts**: To provide data-driven predictions and insights about the tournament's likely outcomes.\n",
    "- **Fans**: To get a better understanding of their favorite team's chances of winning and to make more informed predictions or bets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "- **College Basketball Teams**: Coaches and management could use the predictions to assess their team's chances in the tournament.\n",
    "- **Sports Analysts and Journalists**: To create statistical models that forecast game outcomes and report on trends in the sport.\n",
    "- **Fans and Betting Companies**: To predict team performance and improve engagement with the tournament."
